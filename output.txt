**Title: Types of Ways Birds Fly** Birds utilize various flight methods, primarily categorized into gliding, soaring, and flapping. In gliding, birds extend their wings without flapping, allowing air to flow over them at a slight angle, which generates lift while minimizing energy expenditure. Soaring is a specialized form of gliding where birds ride rising air currents, such as thermals, to maintain altitude without flapping, exemplified by albatrosses that can soar for hours. Flapping involves an up-and-down motion of the wings, providing both lift and thrust; birds adjust their wing angle during the downstroke for optimal performance and reduce resistance on the upward stroke. Each method is adapted to the bird's physical features and environmental needs, enabling diverse flight capabilities. **Author: Science Learning Hub**
