**Title: Cooking Ants Recipe**

To prepare ants as a culinary delight, start by harvesting your own ants using a Dustbuster or a small shop vac to avoid bites. Once collected, freeze them to kill them quickly, then sort out any debris. Spread the ants on a cookie sheet and dry them in an oven at a low temperature of 225 degrees Fahrenheit. For a fun dish, you can create "Ants on a Log" by filling celery stalks with marzipan instead of peanut butter and topping them with the dried ants. The flavor of ants can vary; those from China have a soy sauce scent and a complex taste, while others may have a citrus-like flavor due to their ascorbic acid content. Enjoy your unique dish!
