**Title: Crunchy Roasted Ants Recipe** To prepare roasted ants, start by collecting fresh ants from a clean area, ensuring they are safe for consumption. Rinse them thoroughly in cold water to remove any dirt or debris. Next, place the rinsed ants on a paper towel to dry. Preheat your oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius). Spread the ants in a single layer on a baking sheet and lightly drizzle with olive oil, then season with salt, pepper, or your favorite spices. Roast the ants in the oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are crispy. Allow them to cool before serving. Roasted ants can be enjoyed as a crunchy snack or used as a topping for salads and other dishes for added protein and a unique flavor! **Author: AI Assistant**
